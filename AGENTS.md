## Review guidelines

- During **automated pull request reviews** and **Code Reviews** (e.g., Codex Code Review, CI bots),
  do not modify code or open new commits; only leave comments and suggestions. There are no exceptions unless the user explicitly states "you may edit the code."
- During **interactive IDE sessions**, you may edit code when the user explicitly
  asks for changes or confirms a proposed diff.
